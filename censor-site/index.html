        <h1> Notes on the <span class='censor'>Agency</span> of Non-Human Actors</h1>
          <p>The purpose of this chapter is to examine my work 27b/6. Specifically, I will discuss how 27b/6 develops and deploys its own agency through a multilayered identity (instrument, composition, and system) and through the use of intersecting media (sound, light, sculpture, and theater). In particular, this analysis will focus on the ways in which 27b/6 performs the human operator and reverses the traditional power structure between human performer and musical instrument. I consider this analysis to serve as an explanation of conceptual practice as well as a framework for new modes of composition and electronic music instrument design.
            </p>

<p>27b/6 is perhaps best introduced by the textual component of its score. I specify textual because, as we shall see, 27b/6’s score is multimodal. The followings two pages contain the operating instructions that accompany 27b/6.

27b/6: OPERATING MANUAL

- SETUP/INSTALLATION - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
27b/6 is usually staged but can also be performed in an office in which case the lights should be florescent.

LIGHTS: low, almost blackout

STAGE: 27b/6 is centerstage. A chair and coat rack stage right, the operator’s side.

The operator must never have their jacket on when entering codes. The operator must always put on their jacket before approaching the reset switches. 

The operator enters stage right, dressed in a suit for business, ignoring the audience. Medium gate, not rushing, not dragging, having just arrived at work. The operator removes their jacket and hangs it on the coat rack. They switch on 27b/6 and sit down, good posture.

- OPERATION: SIDE A/SWITCH CODES - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
27b/6 powers on, rising tone, a burst, and some sustained noise.

Lightbulb 1 (stage right) begins to flash. Soon after, 27b/6 begins to make sound like the interference of a cellphone signal with studio electronics. This sequence of events indicate that the operator must enter a code. These are the possible codes:

3 2 1
3 3 3 3 3
1 2 1 2 3
1 3 1 3 1 3
2 2 1 1 3 3
2 3 2 1 2 3	
1 2 3 2 3 1 1 2
2 3 3 3 1 1 2 3

27b/6 will begin by randomly selecting from the first two codes listed above and will gradually expand the number of codes from which it chooses, moving down the list, until all codes are in play. The numbers correspond to the code switches (see diagram). The operator must throw the indicated switch only once per number.

To reiterate, 27b/6 chooses a code at random. The operator does not know which code has been chosen or which codes are in play, and therefore it is imperative that they memorize the codes in order.

After entering the code, the operator must hit the “submit” switch (switch 4) within 3 seconds or else the code will be registered as an incorrect submission.

When the operator enters a code, there are two possible outcomes:

The code is incorrect. 27b/6 makes a negative sound and an additional layer of noise is added to the texture. When this happens, the operator must try another code until they enter the correct code.
The code is correct, 27b/6 makes an affirmative sound, and the rest of sound and lights stop. Silence. The operator sits back down (reaching the codes requires standing, at least a little bit). Soon, 27b/6 will request another code.


- OPERATION: SIDE B/RESET SWITCHES - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
At some point during operation lightbulb 2 (stage left) begins to flash and another layer of sound is added to the texture. This means that 27b/6 has disabled the operator’s controls and they can no longer enter switch codes. The operator must follow the following procedure in order to re-enable the switch code controls: 

Stand up and put on your jacket. 
Walk, without hurry to the other side of 27b/6 (stage left). There you will find 3 switches (the reset switches) spread farther apart than the 4 by the chair (code switches, stage right).
One of the reset switches will re-enable the controls for entering switch codes however, there are three things to keep in mind:
27b/6 has randomly selected the one reset switch that will re-enable the controls for entering switch codes.
The reset switches are on average only 5% effective, therefore the operator will most likely not be sure that they have selected the correct switch until it’s been thrown several times. The operator may need to try all three reset switches.
The reset switches will sometimes make sound; the operator should not rely on this as conveying any useful information.

Once the correct reset switch has been successfully enabled, sound and light stop, and the operator returns to their original station to enter more switch codes. They must first remove their jacket before sitting down.

At any point, 27b/6 will once again disable the operator’s controls. This will continue throughout the duration of the piece. Whenever this happens, the operate must follow the above instructions.

- SHUTDOWN - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Eventually, 27b/6 will shut itself down. At this point, the operator stands up, puts on their jacket, and exits stage right. Work is over.

The following pages of this operating manual contain helpful diagrams and inspection logs.

        <ul>
            <li>Agency is simply <span class='censor'>the ability to affect one’s environment.</span></li>
            <li>All actors--human and non-human--possess agency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is easy to misunderstand these points, and many have. ANT quickly appears cold and inhuman when granting agency to all things is viewed as an erasure of uniquely human qualities like intention, intelligence, and free will. ANT does indeed ignore these qualities, however, it does so in order to trace flows of <span class='censor'>power</span> that result purely from action, rather than intention. However, ANT does not devalue humanness, but instead elevates the role and importance of non-human actors in every environment.
