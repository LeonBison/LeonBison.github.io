            What continues to emerge as the onion in the ointment is a need to distinguish between <span class='censor'>improvisation and composition</span>. More specifically, and perhaps relievingly, what emerges is <span class='censor'>a need to distinguish between my practice of improvisation and my practice of composition.</span> This distinction is important only for the sake of analyzing actors’ agencies within the various art-making systems described in this document and how these agencies can reconfigure our understanding of art-making and human-technology relationships in general.
          </p>
          <p>
            The questions of whether or not agency is present and to what degree appears frequently in studies of improvisational practice. Agency also appears alongside or mixed up with ideas of presence, will, power, intention, and virtuosity, to name a few. It stands to reason that confusion around agency would exist in (sometimes) unplanned, spontaneous music-making, especially when that practice incorporates machines and non-human technologies. It is safe to assume that humans possess agency in their own performance practices (is it?) but is the same true of their musical instruments and musical tools?

        <span class='censor'>ANT’s definition of agency is by far the clearest and most useful for understanding how technology plays an active and complex role in electro-acoustic and electronic performance. ANT’s definition is also, perhaps surprisingly, the most inclusive and concise definition, and while it leads to complexities, self-contradiction, and circular logic-chasing, I find it extraordinarily productive. It can be boiled down to two main points:

            <li>Agency is simply <span class='censor'>the ability to affect one’s environment.</span></li>
            <li>All actors--human and non-human--possess agency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is easy to misunderstand these points, and many have. ANT quickly appears cold and inhuman when granting agency to all things is viewed as an erasure of uniquely human qualities like intention, intelligence, and free will. ANT does indeed ignore these qualities, however, it does so in order to trace flows of <span class='censor'>power</span> that result purely from action, rather than intention. However, ANT does not devalue humanness, but instead elevates the role and importance of non-human actors in every environment.
