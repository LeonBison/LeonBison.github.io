The human performer is, of course, a part of this network. The signals they produce are mediated through a MIDI controller, the drum machine interface, the laptop keyboard, effects pedal switches and knobs, etc. They react to the constantly changing environment through practiced improvisational sensibilities. However, SBSBS is not a quest for improvisational virtuosity. Navigating the SBSBS intermedia system requires that the human embrace a performance mode that reaches beyond the traditional “human as master” performer-instrument configuration.
